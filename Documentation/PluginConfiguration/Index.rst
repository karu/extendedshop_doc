Plugin configuration
--------------------

You have to insert the plugin “Advanced Shop System” like a normal
page content and then you have to specify a type of visualization (in
the view mode, general settings tab).

There are 15 possibilities:

- Product list: displays a list of the product in the 2 ways, list and
  table (table mode is deprecated). It also displays the details view
  for the single product.

- Single Product: displays only the detailed view for the product

- Offers: displays a list of products with the offer price filled

- Search: a simple search field

- Advanced Search: more fields for your research

- Orders info: users can view their order's status

- Basket: displays the list of the products in the cart

- User info: displays data of the logged in user

- Payment: here you can choose payment and shipping methods

- Finalize: display the order's final summary

- User Registered: displays data of the logged in user

- Product page: displays only the detailed view for the product

- Category page: choosing one or more categorie in the 'Category
  Settings' tab, a list of product from selected categories will be
  shown.

- Supplier page: a list of products from the same supplier.

- Latest products: displays latest inserted products, you can choose how
  many in the Latest settings tab.

Look at the Tutorials section to know how to use some of these modes.

If products are stored in a different page you need to select it in
the Starting point or if you are using the “Category mode” you always
have to choose the products categories you want to be listed.
